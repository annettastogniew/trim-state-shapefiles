# trim-state-shapefiles
A python notebook that will trim shapefiles of various US districts for only the states you want.

To use this notebook, run it locally. Specify your states and their fips codes in the  `market` variable. Specify which districts you'd like in the `mapLevels` variable. Variables for the election maps and Who's On Your Ballot tool are already in the notebook.

The notebook will export trimmed files with the prefix 'market-'.
